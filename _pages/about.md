Many problems in fields such as artificial intelligence, statistics, computer vision, natural language
processing, and computational biology can be viewed as the search for a coherent global conclusion
from local information. The probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) framework provides a unified
approach for solving this wide range of problems, enabling efficient inference, decision-making, and
learning in systems with a large number of attributes and huge datasets.

This course will provide a strong foundation for applying PGMs to complex real-world problems, as well
as addressing core research topics in graphical models. Students will learn to construct both Bayesian
and Markov networks, perform inference, and apply learning algorithms. Toward the end of the course,
we will also explore modern probabilistic AI techniques, including generative models and large language
models (LLMs), emphasizing how PGMs underpin many state-of-the-art AI systems.
